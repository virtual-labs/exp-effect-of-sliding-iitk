### Sliding speed and wear characteristics <br>
On a pin-on-disk wear experiment, the sliding speed can be set to ascertain the degree of wear. In the present experiment, the sliding speed varied from XXX to XXX. Other parameters of the experiment are kept constant. It is generally observed that with increasing sliding speed, wear rate also increases. <br>
A generalized effect of sliding speed with load applied during the wear is explained in figure 1.

However, with sudden/ sharp increase in the sliding speed, the wear rate may not increase as expected. This anomaly can be associated with the change in the surface area in contact and change in temperature of the worn surface. Localized heating of the surface area leads to reduced wear of the surfaces. The sliding distance, along with sliding speed is an important parameter for understanding wear.
