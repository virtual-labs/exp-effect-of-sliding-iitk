### About the Experiment 

On a pin-on-disk wear experiment, the sliding speed can be set to ascertain the degree of wear. In the present experiment, the sliding speed varied from XXX to XXX. Other parameters of the experiment are kept constant. It is generally observed that with increasing sliding speed, wear rate also increases.
